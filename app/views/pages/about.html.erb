<div class="about-box">
MEbGDP (Multi-evidence based Gene-Disease Relationship Prediction) 
is a web-based tool allowing biologists to pull evidence from several 
aspects to predict the unknown phenotype-genotype relationship for inheritance diseases. 
For now, it uses graph-based methods to infer the "unknown" from the known disease-gene relationship
information from

and other biological evidences such as disease linkage intervals and animal model phenotypes from 
<%=link_to "MGI", "http://www.informatics.jax.org/", :target => "_balnk" %>. 
<br /><br />
MEbGDP is developped at Division of Health Science Informatics, 
Jonhs Hopkins University School of Medicine by Xiaoli Wu, Hans Bjornsson and Harold Lehmann.
